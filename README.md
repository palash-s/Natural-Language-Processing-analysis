# Natural-Language-Processing-analysis -- MODEL TESTING
 
 
 NLP---
 Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
 
 About the dataset---
 This dataset consists of a few million Amazon customer reviews (input text) and star ratings (output labels) for learning how to train fastText for sentiment analysis.
The idea here is a dataset is more than a toy - real business data on a reasonable scale - but can be trained in minutes on a modest laptop.

Dataset can be accessed through the following link:
